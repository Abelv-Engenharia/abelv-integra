## üîí Critical Security Information

### Exposed Credentials - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Supabase service role key and SMTP credentials were previously exposed in version control.**

**Required Actions:**
1. **Rotate Supabase Service Role Key** - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > Generate new service role key
2. **Update SMTP Credentials** - Change the SMTP password for the email account
3. **Review Access Logs** - Check Supabase and email provider logs for unauthorized access
4. **Audit Database** - Review any suspicious database activity from the exposure period

### Environment Configuration

Never commit environment files containing sensitive data:
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` files for documentation
- ‚ùå Never commit `.env` files to version control
- ‚úÖ Store production secrets in secure vaults or environment variables

### Database Security

The project now includes proper Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
- All sensitive tables have role-based access controls
- User permissions are checked via security definer functions
- CCA-based data isolation is enforced

### Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Users must be authenticated to access any data
   - Session management is handled by Supabase Auth

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based permissions control data access
   - CCA (Cost Center) based data isolation
   - Admin permissions required for sensitive operations

3. **Data Protection**
   - All database functions use secure search paths
   - File uploads go through Supabase Storage with proper access controls
   - Sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for proper fix implementation before disclosure

### Security Monitoring

Regular security practices:
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
- Review RLS policy effectiveness quarterly
- Update dependencies regularly
- Perform security audits on new features
